# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

You can check this project [here](https://pkdx.surge.sh).

## Getting Started - Instructions

First of all, you'are going to need to install NodeJS and NPM. I recommend installing via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Note that the recommendation versions for each one are the following:

- Node: ^14
- NPM: ^6

Next, install all dependencies running:

```
npm install
```

### Running locally

In order to run this project locally, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

If you want to see the project running via Server Side Rendering, run:

```
npm run dev:ssr
```

## Build

Run `npm run build:ssr` in order to build this project, including SSR.
Note that this command **also** run the tests scripts. In case of any tests fail the build are going to be stopped.

Then, you can run `npm run serve:ssr` to view on your browser this project running with SSR.

Finally, you can also access the built project on your browser only, just serving the following directory: `./dist/pokedex/browser`.

Any questions? Feel free to reach me through my [e-mail](mailto:nncl@live.com).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build - Extras

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
